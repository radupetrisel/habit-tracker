# HabitTracker

This is the third challenge project of 100 Days of SwiftUI by Paul Hudson (link [here](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/guide/ios-swiftui/4/3/challenge)). This app is a habit-tracking app, for folks who want to keep track of how much they do certain things. That might be learning a language, practicing an instrument, exercising, or whatever â€“ they get to decide which activities they add, and track it however they want.

As this is a challenge project, there will be no extra challenges at the end.
